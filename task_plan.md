## Decisions Made
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|

## Errors Encountered
| Error | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| ui-ux-pro-max search script path not found at ./skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py | Use absolute path under ~/.codex/skills/ui-ux-pro-max/scripts/search.py |
